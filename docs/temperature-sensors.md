# Indoor temperatures and sensor changes

Upstairs is the existing `indoor_temperature` series. Optional Downstairs
and Bedroom sensors use `downstairs_temperature` and `bedroom_temperature`.
Their SmartThings configuration fields are `downstairs_temp_dev_id` and
`bedroom_temp_dev_id`, alongside the existing `inside_temp_dev_id`. Keep those
identifiers in private configuration. [Recording configuration](recording.md)
also describes MQTT support and optional averaging weights.

The dashboard shows all three readings separately. The thermal model learns the
fixed average of the configured indoor sensors, using equal weights by default.
Selecting different positive weights is a configuration choice; sensor outages
never redistribute weights. A missing contributing sensor makes the average
unavailable for control and learning. A retained stale reading remains labelled
stale; its old value is not evidence of the current temperature.

The committed journal saves each contributing endpoint and weight, observation
lineage, the resolved average and its configuration. This remains one thermal
model, with separate learned comfort references for participating rooms. During
occupied operation, a room below its own reference minus the permitted drop
prevents or ends a heating reduction even if the average is comfortable. These
are observed room limits, not separate room-temperature forecasts or guarantees
that the shared heating system can regulate every room independently.

Historical CSV indoor readings retain their original upstairs meaning. The new
rooms have no invented history before installation. Imported model learning
continues using only the historical upstairs measurement.

## Replacing, moving or adjusting a sensor

Open **Sensor changed** beside the comfort reference, select the sensor and a
reason, then record the change after completing the replacement or move. Reasons
cover replacement, moving, calibration and other measurement changes. The action
records the current server time, including for changes that keep the same device
identifier. It does not edit device configuration or backdate a change.

For a participating indoor sensor or the outdoor temperature, the action:

- Preserves raw readings and the old measurement history.
- Clears affected model validation, accumulated fitting samples, temperature
  state, aggregate and room comfort references. House coefficients remain
  provisional starting estimates until new evidence validates them.
- Discards pending optimisation and marks an active cycle incomplete, preserving
  its original forecast and observations. Normal heating remains available.
- Excludes the transition and a 30-minute settling period, then requires fresh
  measurements from the new period before learning resumes.
- Records one immutable event. Retrying after a lost response uses the same
  request identity and cannot duplicate it.

Garage and zero-weight indoor sensor changes are recorded without resetting the
house model. A change to indoor averaging membership or weights automatically
establishes the corresponding model boundary. The event list also appears on a
read-only replica; changes must be recorded on the controlling instance.

No offset is inferred from the jump at a change. Comparing replacement sensors
side by side can establish relative agreement, but matching their readings does
not prove absolute accuracy. A different position or response time may change
thermal behaviour beyond a constant offset.

## Changes to floor circulation thermostats

The learned comfort reference can move both colder and warmer without a change
to the heat pump's ROOM register. Initial establishment still requires sustained
normal occupied heating. Once established, repeated stable normal fragments of
at least eight hours, with stable final six hours, contribute evidence across
days. At least 24 hours of qualifying evidence spanning 48 hours is required;
updates are limited to 0.2°C per 24 hours of newly evidenced time. Repeated polls
or replay of the same window cannot move the reference again.

Preheating, reduction and recovery hold the reference fixed. Missing or bad
observations, away periods and fireplace effects clear pending adaptation.
Each room uses the same rules for its own reference, allowing the bedroom to
settle at a different normal temperature from Downstairs. This observes the
temperature achieved with the household controls; it cannot independently tell
whether every persistent lower plateau reflects a preference or reduced heating.
