-Implement fast loading to chart, lets say begin with 1500 last lines, and always load enough last lines that the first line is before the starting date (or whole file loaded)
-Implement support for local mqtt-based temperature receives (eg, from shelly or HASS through Meteorologisk Institute); just store last received temp values and time stamps (maybe in storage class, see below) when received (and accept if received within 1h)
