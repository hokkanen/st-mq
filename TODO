-Make README.md better and more descriptive of the app, especially the beginning of it
-Implement support for local mqtt-based temperature receives (eg, from shelly or HASS through Meteorologisk Institute); just store last received temp values and time stamps (maybe in storage class, see below) when received (and accept if received within 1h)
-Chart dataset control buttons don't work when datasets are manually hidden/unhidden from legend, how to fix?
