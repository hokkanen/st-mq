-Polish and error check chart.js with AI, adding also error handling
-Maybe add to chart.js also VAT25.5 savings into chart console?
-Polish and error check easee.js with AI, adding also error handling, and unify style with stmq.js
-Maybe send heaton60 only during 4:45-18:45 european time (5:45-19:45 finnish), and change the spacing to 52.5mins so it is consistent specing (I think hard coding here is ok)
-Implement support for local mqtt-based temperature receives (eg, from shelly or HASS through Meteorologisk Institute); just store last received temp values and time stamps (maybe in storage class, see below) when received (and accept if received within 1h)
