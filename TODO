-Chart should ignore NaN entries, and not crash (error shown in browser console)
-Mqtt-control.js should store the current 24h period prices, and the previous temp values, if API calls fail, use previous values

-Chart savings indicator with and without car charging! Shown only in console for now with 0% VAT. Maybe add into html interface with VAT selection option?

-Move config stuff into scripts/script_modules/config-handler.js and import it as module into scripts
-Check that the config format is correct and it contains the right keys (if not maybe recreate config structure and use defaults (fi, 00000, local hass mqtt, etc))

-Implement support for local mqtt-based temperature receives (eg, from shelly); just store last received temp values and time stamps (maybe in storage class, see below) when received (and accept if received within 1h)
-Implement storage class for kWh prices, so they would not rely on hourly query (would store 24h time period, but maybe still check that the hourly query matches?), could be combined with mqtt temp receives; both would store values and receive time, and use that to figure out if the data is still valid
-The mqtt temps could also come from hass, eg, from Meteorologisk institute that is there integrated already
