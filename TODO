-Implement Tesla logging support, ask Grok to implement into easee-query.js, reusing as much functions as possible using tesla local api
    -easee.csv gets 1 new tsla_curr column, this is only nonzero when tesla API confirms charging is 3-phase (1-phase tesla charging not logged from tesla, shows in equalizer chart only)
    -update chart.js to plot tesla charging as stacked fill on top of easee charger if present at the same time, maybe lighter red fill (all currents equal tsla_curr)
    -make sure tesla is not charging from easee by checking if easee+tesla < total, both chargers are charging (known from current), if these are true, wait 10sec (to make sure the charging didnt start 1sec before the query and currents have time to stabilize) and do a new query from easee and tesla, make sure both are still charging and easee+tesla < total, then check that charging currents are not the same within maybe 5% range, and charged amount of kwh is not same within maybe 5%, only now we can assume tesla is not charging from easee, otherwise assume it is.
-Implement support for local mqtt-based temperature receives (eg, from shelly or HASS through Meteorologisk Institute); just store last received temp values and time stamps (maybe in storage class, see below) when received (and accept if received within 1h)
